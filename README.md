# DRA-Antenna-optimization-using-ML

This was my final year project...
The objective of this project was to optimize the antenna design process with the help of machine learning models4


We have used DRA antenna beacuse of it's miniature size.

We have used KNN, ANN, random forest, and GPR to predict the |S11| parameter of antenna from its dimensions.
